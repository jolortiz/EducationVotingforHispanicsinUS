        <h1>The State of Mexican-Americans from 1980 to 2015</h1>
        <p>I want this visualization to tell the story of mexican-americans in the 2000s. The visualization will display different facts about mexican-americans from generation to generation. These facts will include income, poverty, education, death and birth rates, incarceration rates, religious beliefs etc. My visualization will provide an overhead look at the population as a whole, capturing the evolution through time comparing how different factors affect each other.</p>

        <p>Most of my data will be coming from the Pew Research Center which has plenty of data for me to work with. I will concentrate on the years 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015. However, I may add years to visualize certain aspects of the culture that are changing. For example, the move away from catholicism and towards christianity shown in the second link.</p>

        <p>I have searched for visualizations about mexican americans but mostly found visualizations about foreign immigration and population of hispanics in the US(see links 1 and 2). These can be useful however because I could use the population or immigration data as a baseline. I want to make my visualization based more on the 3rd link. A radar graph with a time slider I believe would be great in showing the difference between the data throughout time.</p>
